- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JoeDobos
- ðŸ‘€ I studied Mathematics at the University of Minnesota (2017-2021). 
- ðŸŒ± In my freetime, I enjoy building on my coding skills in Python and R that I learned during college for mathematical/statistical modeling. I am using this github account to store files from college and self-practice. 
- ðŸ“« I can be reached via email at josephdobos21@gmail.com
